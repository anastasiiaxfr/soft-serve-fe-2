Our approach centered on blending traditional aesthetics with modern lighting technology. We used advanced LED solutions to highlight the hotel's grand architecture, ensuring that each area received its own thematic lighting that shifts with the mood and time of day. Ambient, task, and accent lighting techniques were employed to enhance both functionality and ambiance.

The main lobby's lighting was designed to adapt from a bright, welcoming day-time setting to a more subdued, intimate evening atmosphere. Special weather-resistant fixtures were used for outdoor areas, emphasizing durability without compromising on style.
